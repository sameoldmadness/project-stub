# BEM Methodology

Blocks can be moved around on a page, moved between pages or projects. The implementation of blocks as independent entities makes it possible to change their position on the page and ensures their proper functioning and appearance.[^2]

With BEM you can **mix** multiple blocks and elements on the same DOM node which allows you to keep the DOM tree clean.

BEM makes an emphasise on **reusability** by distinguishing between independent components (*blocks*) and components that cannot be used on their own (*elements*).
